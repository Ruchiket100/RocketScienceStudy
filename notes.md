## Principals on which rocket works on - 
### # Newtons 2nd law - 
    netForce = mass x accelaration
### #  Newtons 3rd law
    Mutual Interaction creates equal & opposite Force

## Types of Rockets
---
1. **Model Rocket**  
---
> `Rocket Engine -`
> they are classified into liquid rockets and solid rockets  
> **Liquid Rocket** = The fuel and the source of oxygen (oxidizer) necessary for combustion are stored separately and pumped into combution chamber where burning occurs.  
>   * Liquid rockets tend to be heavier and more complex because of the pumps used to move the fuel and oxidizer.
> ![Engine working](/source/liquid%20rocket.png)
> 
> **Solid Rocket** = The fuel and oxidizer are mixed together to form solid propellent, propellent will burn when it exposed to the external source of heat.  
> * Propellent engine mechanism

>![Engine performance](/source/Engine%20performance.png)
> **nozzle** = Used to accelerate hot gasses and produce thrust

1. **High Power Rockets**

### Line between Model & High power rocketry
* uses motor more than 160 Newton-second impulse
* uses motor with more than 80N of average thrust
* exeeds 125g of propellent
* Weighs more than 1500g including motor
* uses of ductile metals
